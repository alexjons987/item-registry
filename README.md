# Final assignment: Item Registry
A REST API for registering, filtering and querying virtual items (entities) linked to users and their inventory.

## Development description
This project was built using [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) 3.5.9 with Java 21 ([Microsoft OpenJDK](https://www.microsoft.com/openjdk) 21.0.9). Testing was implemented using the [JUnit](https://junit.org/)  5 platform. During development the application used a local relation database running [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) 8.0.43. The project was finally containerized with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Development was done in [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) 2025.2 (Community Edition) on [Windows 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10).

## Limitations
* Some endpoints (e.g. filtering of items) are not yet implemented.
* Test coverage is not 100%.
